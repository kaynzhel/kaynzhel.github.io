## Current Notes
Currently, the personal website is a static one, created using HTML and CSS. It is periodically updated based on the events that have happened in my life.

## Future Plans
I plan to redesign the website to include dynamic changes and other features like a built-in contact system to easily provide feedback or to ask an inquiry.
