  <h1 id="winter-2021-semester-done">Winter 2021 Semester: Accomplished</h1>
  <p>The winter 2021 semester is finally done! It has been a rollercoaster of an academic year. Looking back, my second year of an undergraduate degree is much harder than my first one. I believe this is primarily due to the current pandemic and the effects it has caused: online learning (new environment), relatively worse mental health, and the general fear of contracting the Covid-19 virus.</p>
  <p>It has been difficult to cope with the new learning environment, and that goes for both instructors and students. At the start of the academic year, I thought to myself that asynchronous lectures were better for my learning; however, as time went on, I found myself to be more engaged with the course material if the course offers synchronous material as well as posting the live videos online. At so many points during the year, I was in overdrive; it seemed like I could not and should not stop. I remember one time, I had two exams and a few assignments or labs due in one week, and at one point, I broke down. I was burnt out. With that, I decided to give myself time to relax more, and that helped! Spending time with my little brother, family, and friends (online of course) did wonders to my mental health. Before I know it, winter term is done!</p>
  <p>I have five final exams left. I am going to power through it, and do the best I can. For anyone reading this, my advice is not to burn yourself out, but also do your best in your studies. In a sea of assignments, labs, papers, and exams, I know it is tedious to keep yourself afloat, but hang in there. There are a lot of anchors or lifeboats that can help you. Strive hard but also enjoy life.</p>
