  <h1 id="its-been-a-while">It’s been a while</h1>
  <p>It’s been a while. My last blog post was 6 months ago! I have a lot of catching up to do, but I’ll make it brief.</p>
  <h2 id="summer-research">Summer Research</h2>
  <p>The four months of research work that I did were incredibly fulfilling. I got to work with and learn from talented and knowledgeable people. I had the opportunity to work on various experiments like variant analysis on spike proteins and membrane proteins of Sars-CoV-2 and understanding its time series mutation. Moreover, I was also given a brief overview about Multiple Sequence Alignment with the use of <a href="https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/">MAFFT</a> and <a href="https://www.jalview.org">Jalview</a>.</p>
  <p>During the last stretch of our research work, I had the opportunity to help write a manuscript about the given study. Fingers crossed that it gets published!</p>
  <h2 id="customer-service-job">Customer Service Job</h2>
  <p>While I was engaged in doing research work on the weekdays, I was busy serving food to customers on the weekends. For seven days a week from April to August 2021, I was working! I had some breaks, of course, but general exhaustion also came into play. It was also the time when the government of Alberta declared that the province would be “open for summer.” People flocked to the mall I was working at, and it was tiring to say the least. Therefore when I had some filler days, I spent them playing games and spending time with my little brother.</p>
  <h2 id="university">University!</h2>
  <p>During the first few days, I was very excited to explore campus once again. It was as if it was my first time walking through the halls of various buildings. It was like it was my first year all over again. However, it wasn’t that long until I realized the impending workload that comes with school. Here’s to hoping that I finish the semester with good grades and new knowledge!</p>
