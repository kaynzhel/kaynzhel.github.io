<p>I am very excited to say that my partner and I won second place for our very first hackathon! We created a Java-based Android application to help take care of people’s mental health, which is the theme of the competition. You can find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/kael-org/control">Github page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Since it was our first hackathon, we both didn’t know what to expect. At first, we were hesitant on joining. “What would it be like? Will it be difficult? Will we even finish?” — These were the questions we asked ourselves and to each other, but we did enter, and I’m glad we did!</p>
<p>We were a bit hectic at first, but the experience was certainly fulfilling. I think that working together helped us build our teamwork and collaboration skills that will both assist us in our future endeavours.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>We will certainly be joining other ones in the future! The process alone made us learn various applicable skills, and so we are both excited to try more.</p>
<p>That will be all for now. Take care!</p>
